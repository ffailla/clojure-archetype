clojure-archetype

Installation:

Clone the git repo and run:

mvn install

This will install the maven archetype in your local maven repository.

Usage:

Copy the cljproject file to a location in your path.  Run the following to create a new clojure project:

cljproject {groupId} {artifactId}

where {groupId} {artifactId} corresponds to the maven group and artifact ids respectively.  A new directory named by {artifactId} will be created and a template clojure project will be there referencing the following:

clojure-1.2.0
clojure-contrib-1.2.0
swank-clojure-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT

A single "Hello World" clj file will be created (src/main/clojure/app.clj) containing a -main fn.
